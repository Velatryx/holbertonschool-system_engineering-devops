###Components
Web Server (Nginx);
Role: Serves static content and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
Why Added: Optimizes static content delivery, reducing load on the application server.

###Application Server
Role: Handles dynamic content and business logic, interacts with the database.
Why Added: Separates logic from the web server for better performance and scalability.

###Database Server (MySQL)
Role: Stores and retrieves application data.
Why Added: Isolates the database for better performance and resource management.

###Load Balancer (HAproxy)
Role: Distributes traffic to web/application servers for load balancing.
Why Added: Ensures high availability and balances traffic load across servers.

###Key Concepts
Load Balancer Cluster (HAproxy):
Why Clustered: Provides redundancy and high availability. If one fails, the other takes over.
How It Works: Distributes traffic evenly using algorithms like round-robin or least connections.

##Web Server:
Role: Serves static content, passes dynamic requests to the application server.
Why Separate: Allows independent scaling and resource optimization for static vs dynamic content.

###Application Server:
Role: Handles dynamic content and business logic.
Why Separate: Improves performance by offloading application logic from the web server.

Database Server:

Role: Manages data storage and queries.

Why Separate: Optimizes performance and resources dedicated to data management.

Flow

User Request: Sent to the HAproxy load balancer.

Load Balancer: Routes traffic to the web server.

Web Server (Nginx): Serves static content, forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server: Processes logic, queries the database.

Database Server: Handles data requests.

Response: Sent back to the user via the web server.

###enefits

!Scalability: Easily add more web or application servers.
!Fault Tolerance: Load balancer cluster and database failover ensure availability.
!Performance: Each server handles specific tasks, improving efficiency.

###Potential Issues

!SPOF: Single points of failure (e.g., database or load balancer) need redundancy.

!Security: Implement HTTPS and firewalls to protect data.

Complexity: More servers require effective monitoring and management tools.
