Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

Three Servers:

Web Server: Handles incoming requests and serves static content.

App Server: Processes the business logic and interacts with the database.

Database Server: Stores all the website’s data (MySQL).

Firewalls (3 Layers):

Firewall 1: Between the internet and load balancer (blocks external threats).

Firewall 2: Between load balancer and web servers (limits access).

Firewall 3: Between web servers and database (restricts access to only web/app servers).

SSL/TLS Encryption:

Why HTTPS? Protects user data during transmission.

SSL Termination: Decrypts traffic at the load balancer to reduce load on web servers. Ensure internal traffic between load balancer and web servers is secured (use internal TLS).

Monitoring:

Web Server Monitoring: Tracks performance (response times, errors).

App Server Monitoring: Monitors app logic, request handling.

Database Monitoring: Monitors database performance (query speed, replication).

Purpose: Catch issues early, track health, and alert on anomalies (e.g., QPS spikes).

Potential Issues

SSL Termination: Internal traffic between load balancer and web servers needs encryption to avoid exposing data.

Single MySQL Server for Writes: Single point of failure. Use replication or clustering for redundancy and better scalability.

Mixing Web, App, and DB on the Same Server: Causes resource contention, limits scaling, and increases risk of full failure if the server goes down.
